5. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npx prisma generate
   ```
6. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

This boilerplate uses a structured development workflow to maintain code quality and consistency:

### Feature Development Scripts

Located in the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Create a new feature with proper structure
./scripts/create-new-feature.sh "feature description"

# Set up development plan
./scripts/setup-plan.sh

# Update AI agent context
./scripts/update-agent-context.sh
```

### Git Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   # or
   git checkout -b docs/update-readme
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards

3. **Test your changes:**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   npm test
   npm run e2e:headless
   ```

4. **Commit using conventional commits:**

   ```bash
   npm run commit
   # This opens an interactive prompt for conventional commit messages
   ```

5. **Push your branch:**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict type checking
- Use meaningful type names
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use `unknown` over `any` when type is uncertain

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for component props
- Follow the component naming convention: `PascalCase`
- Use meaningful prop names
- Implement proper error boundaries where needed

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the design system defined in `globals.css`
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG guidelines)
